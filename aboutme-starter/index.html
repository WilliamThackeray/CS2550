				<h2 id="poem">My Haiku</h2>
				<blockquote>
					Haiku's are easy. <br> But sometimes they don't make sense. <br> Refrigerator.
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					This is a poem I have written and known since my high school career. <br>I enjoy the unrelated final line of the poem
					that tend to through people off and surprise them.

			<h2  id="interests">My Personal Intrests:</h2>
			<p>
				One of my biggest interests right now is livestreaming. I will livestream the video games I play 
				on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thack_whack" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a> and I am actually an affiliate on 
				Twitch as well. This means I have me own custom emojis for my channel and people can subscribe 
				for about $5 a month to help support me and stuff. It's a super fun hobby I have.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another one of my interests is actually graphic design. I plan on doing a minor in DGM which will 
				be a mix of graphic design and game design right now, with some website design classes mixed in. At 
				this point I'm not sure which path I want to take but I am willing to do a second major in one of 
				those if I enjoyed it enough. Anyways, I like graphic design enough that I've even 
				<a href="https://www.dgm2120.thackwhackgraphics.com/08Media/index.html" target="_blank">created a website</a>
				for my graphic design company where I will create different graphics and artwork for other small streamers 
				and content creators.
			</p>
			<p>
				My last intrest I'll mention right now, is that I love to rock climb. Rock climbing is an activity I've 
				loved doing for years. I have enjoyed it since my first climb and I've been hooked ever since. I even 
				got my brother-in-law to love it as well so we are kinda climbing buddies. My favorite place to go climbing
				is up Big Cottenwood Canyon. There are some really amazing climbs up there.
